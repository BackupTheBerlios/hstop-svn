INSTALL:
install pyopenssl to use pyhstopd's ssl-support
install pycurl to use pyhstopc's speedblasting curl-support

copy pyhstop{c,d} whereever you want, and make them executable

RUN:
just start pyhstop{c,d}
by default pyhstop{c,d} will look in `pwd` for his config file pyhstop.conf
but you can set this file with -c $configfile

~enjoy~
